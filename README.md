# Getting Started
## Flask Back End
In order to run the project, Conda must first be installed. Once Conda is installed, run one of the following commands to create an environment and install dependencies:
- `bash setup-env-unix.sh`
- TODO: Create Powershell script for Powershell users
This creates an environment named 'stu-rec' that contains all the necessary dependencies for the backend API.

Once the environment is set up, it must be activated with `conda activate stu-rec`.
## React Front End
To start the app cd into 'react'. Then run `npm start` and the app will open in your browser.
