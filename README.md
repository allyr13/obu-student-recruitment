# Getting Started
## Backend
In order to run the project, Conda must first be installed. Once Conda is installed, run one of the following commands to create an environment and install dependencies:
- `bash setup-env-unix.sh`
- TODO: Create Powershell script for Powershell users
This creates an environment named 'stu-rec' that contains all the necessary dependencies for the backend API.
